#PP-Travels

This project is a presentation website that deals with my travel experiences 

-> This project will be pretty much HTML and CSS only.
   Goal is to focus on the layout and design of the website to hone my HTML and CSS skills.

To do:

-create the index page that directs to each page - done 
-create the page for Australia - done 
-create the page for New York - done
-create the page for Italy - done
-create a link that redirects to the index page, on each page - done

-make a French version of the website --> toggle button on index page + each page - done
    -rewrite the content of each page in French

--> Website has to be responsive 
    -start mobile first and move on to desktop

--> Make toggle buttons more obvious by adding description next to them - done
--> Reorganise layout of pages for desktop versions

Difficulties encountered:

-setting the background image on the index page for each div, so that it fills its parent properly
    -sorted out: used the background-image CSS property along with the background-size CSS property
