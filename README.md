#PP-Travels

This project is a presentation website that deals with my travel experiences 

To do:

-create the index page that directs to each page
-create the page for Australia
-create the page for New York
-create the page for Italy
-create a link that redirects to the index page, on each page

--> Website has to be responsive 
    -start mobile first and move on to desktop


Difficulties encountered:

-setting the background image on the index page for each div, so that it fills its parent properly
