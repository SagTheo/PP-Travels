        <h2>When was it</h2>
        <p>I spent an entire year in Australia, from September 2017 until September 2018.
            I was able to stay for that long thanks to a WHV(Working Holiday Visa) that allows
            backpackers to stay in the country for one year and even two, if certain conditions
            are fulfilled.

        <h2>What did I do there</h2>
        <p>I spent the year backpacking around the country.</p>
        <p>Here is how my journey went:</p> 
            <ul>
                <li>I first landed in Perth, on the West Coast of Australia. I hopped from hostel to hostel
                    a few times before eventually returning to the very first one I stayed at, City Perth Backpackers, 
                    which is where I met all the friends that I made whislt I was Down Under.
                </li>
                <li>After a few months in Perth, I embarked on a one-month road trip on the australian
                    west coast, with three British friends who stayed at that hostel mentionned earlier. We visited
                    heaps of places, most of them natural landscapes, beaches, national parks, and towns far removed
                    in the Australian Outback. We scubadived, swam with manta rays, did a wine tour, went on hikes, 
                    and partied of course! We spent most nights in camps that sometimes had nothing but the ground
                    to mount our tents on. Those nights were where I witnessed the most beautiful night skies I have 
                    ever seen to this day.
                </li>
                <li>We then returned to Perth, and reunited with the rest of the group. I spent, I believe, another
                    month and a half, maybe two months there.
                </li>
                <li>My time on the west coast came to an end. I decided to go to Adelaide and stay there for a week,
                    to visit an aunt and her family, and take some time to explore the city.
                </li>
                <li>After Adelaide, I travelled to Melbourne, which was next on the list of cities I wanted to go to. 
                    Now, although the whole experience was amazing and unforgetable, my heart goes to Melbourne when I think
                    of a particular place in Australia I would want to settle in if I were to do such a thing. 
                    I can't exactly explain why, but that city just struck me. The buildings, the streets, the people,
                    the hostel I stayed at, the weather, the vibe...I felt really good there and it is definitely 
                    a place I will go back to one day.
                </li>
                <li>I moved to New Zealand after spending a few months in Melbourne. I went to Wellington, New Zealand's 
                    capital, to see my girlfriend at the time, for a month.
                </li>
                <li>I then returned to Australia, Brisbane this time. I had in mind to stay for a couple of months
                    there, which wound up being only a couple of weeks, as I struggled to find a job, and money
                    started to seriously run out.
                </li>
                <li>As a consequence I played it safe and decided to go back to Melbourne, where I stayed for about
                    a month and half I would say.
                </li>
                <li>I went to see my girlfriend in Wellington again, for two weeks only, as I was getting closer
                    to the end of my visa, and I wanted to make the most of my time left in that area of the globe.
                </li>
                <li>So I flew from New Zealand to Sydney. The plan was to finish my trip in that city from the 
                    beginning. Sydney is a city that has a lot to offer and I quite enjoyed visiting it. Specifically,
                    I remember the park that I would go to almost everyday to workout, which became one of my 
                    favourite places there.
                </li>
                <li>Before my visa ran out, I wanted to go back to Brisbane, as I didn't really get to enjoy it 
                    the first time. I spent the last week there, just exploring, took a day trip to Sunshine Coast, 
                    and another one to Gold Coast, taking in my last few days on the other side of the planet.
                </li>
                <li>I returned to Sydney the day before my flight back home, spent the night in a hotel nearby
                    and had to wait ten hours in the airport, before boarding the plane that marked the end of 
                    this amazing year.
