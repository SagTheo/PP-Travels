        <h2>When was it</h2>
        <div>
           <p>I spent an entire year in Australia, from September 2017 until September 2018.
            I was able to stay for that long thanks to a WHV(Working Holiday Visa) that allows
            backpackers to stay in the country for one year and even two, if certain conditions
            are fulfilled.

        <h2>What did I do there</h2>
        <div>
           <p>I spent the year backpacking around the country.</p>
            <p>Here is how my journey went:</p> 
                <ul>
                    <li>I first landed in Perth, on the West Coast of Australia. I hopped from hostel to hostel
                        a few times before eventually returning to the very first one I stayed at, City Perth Backpackers, 
                        which is where I met all the friends that I made whislt I was Down Under.
                        <div class="img perth" title="Perth"></div>
                    </li>
                    <li>After a few months in Perth, I embarked on a one-month road trip on the australian
                        west coast, with three British friends who stayed at that hostel mentionned earlier. We visited
                        heaps of places, most of them natural landscapes, beaches, national parks, and towns far removed
                        in the Australian Outback. We scubadived, swam with manta rays, did a wine tour, went on hikes, 
                        and partied of course! We spent most nights in camps that sometimes had nothing but the ground
                        to mount our tents on. Those nights were where I witnessed the most beautiful night skies I have 
                        ever seen to this day.
                        <div class="img karijini" title="Karijini National Park"></div>
                    </li>
                    <li>We then returned to Perth, and reunited with the rest of the group. I spent, I believe, another
                        month and a half, maybe two months there.
                    </li>
                    <li>My time on the west coast came to an end. I decided to go to Adelaide and stay there for a week,
                        to visit an aunt and her family, and take some time to explore the city.
                        <div class="img adelaide" title="Adelaide"></div>
                    </li>
                    <li>After Adelaide, I travelled to Melbourne, which was next on the list of cities I wanted to go to. 
                        Now, although the whole experience was amazing and unforgetable, my heart goes to Melbourne when I think
                        of a particular place in Australia I would want to settle in if I were to do such a thing. 
                        I can't exactly explain why, but that city just struck me. The buildings, the streets, the people,
                        the hostel I stayed at, the weather, the vibe...I felt really good there and it is definitely 
                        a place I will go back to one day.
                        <div class="img melbourne" title="Melbourne"></div>
                    </li>
                    <li>I moved to New Zealand after spending a few months in Melbourne. I went to Wellington, New Zealand's 
                        capital, to see my girlfriend at the time, for a month.
                        <div class="img wellington" title="Wellington"></div>
                    </li>
                    <li>I then returned to Australia, Brisbane this time. I had in mind to stay for a couple of months
                        there, which wound up being only a couple of weeks, as I struggled to find a job, and money
                        started to seriously run out.
                        <div class="img brisbane" title="Brisbane"></div>
                    </li>
                    <li>As a consequence I played it safe and decided to go back to Melbourne, where I stayed for about
                        a month and half I would say.
                    </li>
                    <li>I went to see my girlfriend in Wellington again, for two weeks only, as I was getting closer
                        to the end of my visa, and I wanted to make the most of my time left in that area of the globe.
                    </li>
                    <li>So I flew from New Zealand to Sydney. The plan was to finish my trip in that city from the 
                        beginning. Sydney is a city that has a lot to offer and I quite enjoyed visiting it. Specifically,
                        I remember the park that I would go to almost everyday to workout, which became one of my 
                        favourite places there.
                        <div class="img sydney" title="Sydney"></div>
                    </li>
                    <li>Before my visa ran out, I wanted to go back to Brisbane, as I didn't really get to enjoy it 
                        the first time. I spent the last week there, just exploring, took a day trip to Sunshine Coast, 
                        and another one to Gold Coast, taking in my last few days on the other side of the planet.
                    </li>
                    <li>I returned to Sydney the day before my flight back home, spent the night in a hotel nearby
                        and had to wait ten hours in the airport, before boarding the plane that marked the end of 
                        this incredible year.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            <p>In order to pay for accomodation, food, a phone plan and that sort of expenses, I worked small jobs
                throughout the year. I worked a few shifts as a charity fundraiser, a few shifts as a dishwasher, but
                mainly I did construction jobs, which involved carrying furniture around, digging trenches, cleaning etc, 
                and I delivered food thanks to Uber Eats. So I would find and buy a bike on websites like Gumtree, register as 
                an Uber Eats delivery driver and then started riding through the streets of the city I was in at the time, 
                delivering food to people. I also worked for accomodation, meaning I wouldn't get paid however, I no longer had 
                to pay for rent, and that was a pretty good deal conisdering I only had to work two shifts a week.

        <h2>Why did I do that trip</h2>
        <div>
           <p>I left France to go to Australia in September 2017, which was right after summer break after graduating from
            university. I now had a degree, but I had no idea what I could do with it. In fairness, I graduated simply
            because I didn't have anything else better to do at the time, and I didn't know what should come next. Besides,
            I had lost interest in my studies probably during the second year of my bachelor's, so really, I graduated 
            merely for the sake of graduating.
            </p>
            <p>Having said that, I wasn't going to stay there with my degree waiting for something to happen. I knew I needed
                something new, I deeply felt the need for some adventure. At first, I wanted to go and do some voluntary
                farm work in the United States, as part of the WWOOF program (WorldWide Opportunities on Organic Farms), but I 
                quickly realised that the paperwork to stay in the USA for more than what the tourist visa allowed was going to 
                be too much of a hassle. That is when I heard about the Working Holiday Visa. Many countries where offering
                foreigners the possibility to go there for a year, but Australia became the obvious choice right away. From there 
                on, I knew what that adventure was going to be.
            </p>
            <p>I wanted to go on a long trip abroad also because I wanted to improve my English. It wasn't bad when I left,
                but there was definitely room for improvement. That is also what gave me the confidence to embark on that
                journey, as I knew that at the very least, I would come back with the ability to speak another language pretty
                much fluently, which is always an asset.
            </p>
            <p>What convinced me for good that I should do that trip however, and leave everything and everyone I had known for
                the past twenty-one years(for a year only of course), was that unexplainable feeling that I had deep down, that
                told me it was the right thing to do. Trusting that gut feeling was, and still is, one of the best decisions 
                I have ever made in my life.
