        <h2>When was it</h2>
        <div class="flex">
            <p>I travelled to Italy, Florence to be exact, on September 1st, 2021. I came back to France three months
            after, on November 30th.

        <h2>What did I do there</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Between the time I came back from New York and the time I went to Italy, I started a course to learn 
                how to code and become a web developer - side note, the skills that I developed during that course
                allowed me to create this very website. That course was fully online therefore, I could take the classes
                from anywhere I wanted. From there, I thought to myself that if I was to be at home everyday studying,
                I might as well do it in another country.
            </p>
            <p>So that is what I did when I was in Florence, I kept studying almost everyday, at my own pace.
                Of course, that ability to manage my time as I saw fit was put to good use.
            </p>
            <p>I visited Florence little by little, strolling in the streets aimlessly, which is my most preferred way 
                to discover a new place. I got to admire il Duomo, Santa Croce, il Ponte Vecchio, enjoy the panoramic
                view offered by piazzale Michelangelo too. 
            </p>
            <p>Lucky enough, Florence is pretty well positioned geografically, which allowed me to take the train
                a few times and in a matter of two hours roughly, I would be in another city. That is how I managed to
                visit: 
            </p>
            <div class="flex">
                <p class="badge">Genoa</p>
                <div class="img genoa" title="Genoa"></div>
            </div> 
            <div class="flex">
                <div class="img rome desktop" title="Rome"></div>
                <p class="badge">Rome</p>
                <div class="img rome no-desktop" title="Rome"></div>
            </div>   
            <div class="flex">
                <p class="badge">Venice</p>
                <div class="img venice" title="Venice"></div>
            </div>    
            <div class="flex">
                <div class="img monterosso desktop" title="Cinque Terre"></div>
                <p class="badge cinqueterre">le Cinque Terre</p>
                <div class="img monterosso no-desktop" title="Cinque Terre"></div>
            </div>   
            <p>   
                That last place is where I went on an unintended hike that
                led to an amazing view over the sea. 
                I really enjoyed that about Italy, it was easy to go on one-day trips, which I counted as mini-adventures.
                The city is also suited to nice bike rides and walks. For example, I got to go to Fiesole, a village
                next to Florence, which gifted me with the most awesome view of the city and the mountains that surrond
                it. Coupled with the beginning of a sunset, that day counts as one of the most memorable moments of my trip
                to Italy.
            </p>
            <p>It goes without saying that I couldn't go to Italy without experiencing the food.
                First thing that comes to mind is pizza of course, which I had a few times. Just as equally famous is
                pasta, that I prepared myself much more than I ordered it at restaurants.
                Another staple of the list of unavoidable Italian foods is il gelato(ice cream). Ice cream shops,
                le gelaterie, can be found everywhere, in the streets of Florence as well as everywhere in Italy.
                I also got to taste the focaccia genovese, which is flour, olive oil and salt turned into delicious bread
                that you can eat raw as it is or dipped in sauce or use it as a way to eat your food with.
                Another honorable mention is la schiacciata, which is a sandwich made by a famous food franchise called
                All'Antico Vinaio, which can be found in Italy of course but there is also a restaurant in New York, as its
                success could not be contained solely in Italy. And indeed, I had to wait 45 minutes to get mine, and when
                you realise that it takes a minute for it to be handed to you, that tells you just how many people
                rush there everyday to get a taste of it. Was not a disappointment!

        <h2>Why did I do that trip</h2>
        <div>
            <p>Australia sparked my love for travelling, and New York confirmed it as something that was going to
                define my life. This third trip, just like the many others that I have planned in mind, was a way for me 
                to live the life that I envision for myself.
            </p>
            <p>Why Italy? Well, after having reached quite an advanced level of English, I thought to myself that perhaps,
                it was time to learn another language. After all, I not only had discovered a passion for travelling in
                Australia, but also a love for learning new languages. I thought back to all the times I got 
                to speak with foreigners, hearing their accent, and their native language. In doing so, I realised that 
                Italian was the next obvious choice: the language is beautiful, full of melody, the Italian culture
                is rich and the country doesn't lack gorgeous places to explore. Bonus point, French being my native
                language, I had an advantage with Italian, as both languages are rather close grammatically and 
                vocabulary wise, which was nice to ease myself into learning a language from scratch, something I 
                hadn't done in a long time.
            </p>
            <p>I picked Florence because I had always heard how beautiful of a city it was, and I wasn't so keen
                on spending three months in any other Italian city, to be fair. Besides, after New York, I wanted to 
                give living in a smaller, more human-sized city a go, which turned out to be really enjoyable.
