        <h2>When was it</h2>
        <div>
           <p>I left France to go to the United States, to New York exactly, in September 2019. I came back five months
            later, in February 2020.
            </p>

        <h2>What did I do there</h2>
        <div>
           <p>I spent five months in New York on an international campus, to take English classes. I organised this trip 
            thanks to an agency, EF(Education First), that specialises in sending foreigners abroad to learn another
            language. To be honest, I didn't really need to take English classes given that my level had skyrocketed already
            after spending a full year in an English-speaking country, even though there was still lots of room for 
            improvement of course(and there still is). However it was one way to stay for some time in the US without
            any problem.
            </p>
            <div class="img nycampus" title="Tarrytown"></div>
            <p>So I had daily classes, from Monday to Friday, all dealing with different topics. There was one about
                crime and psychology for example, another one about New York's culture, one where we would discuss a given 
                subject for an hour etc. I also had a main teacher, nearly everyday, who oriented his teaching towards
                speaking and debating mainly, as he judged that that was the most appropriate way to develop our ability
                to speak the language even further, given the overall level of English of the class I was in, which was 
                pretty advanced. We did some grammar and vocabulary focused exercises, too.
            </p> 
            <p>Apart from the classes, the campus had in place clubs, organised at night usually, to which students
                could attend to take part in activities. The one I always went to was the TED-x club, every monday night.
                It was a great way to enhance my ability to be comfortable when speaking English, as many of the exercises
                that we did during each session involved speaking in front of others. It was all done in a very friendly, 
                relaxed spirit, which made it very enjoyable.
            </p>
            <p>There was also a bar on the campus, where students could go to have a drink and grab something to eat.
                That was the place where parties where organised, every once in a while.
            </p>
            <p>And of course, I visited New York. The campus was actually located in Tarrytown, but the city that never sleeps 
                was only one train ride away. I got to see the Statue of Liberty, <div class="img statueofliberty" title="Statue of Liberty"></div>
                the Rockefeller Center, Times Square obviously, <div class="img timessquare" title="Times Square"></div>
                the Brooklyn bridge, <div class="img brooklynbridge" title="Brooklyn Bridge"></div>
                the 9/11 memorial, and all the very touristic but still awesome places 
                of New York. I didn't exactly visit the other boroughs, as Manhattan had plenty to offer, and I wasn't planning
                on trying to visit everything anyway.
            </p>
            <p>One of the best things about that trip was that, given the time of the year where I was there, I had the 
                opportunity to experience four big celebrations in the US: Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas, and 
                New Year's Eve. Halloween is on another level there: big parades, everyone dressing up, people
                decorating their house and front yard, it was awesome to be part of it.
                I was also given the amazing opportunity to celebrate Thanksgiving in an actual American family, taste
                the food that they eat typically for the occasion, and get a bit more of an intimate insight into the 
                American culture, for which I am extremely grateful.
                Christmas does feel magical in New York, with all the illuminations, the shows, the huge and fully 
                decorated Christmas trees, the snow...Once again something that I will never forget.
                Finally, New Year's Eve is just a huge party in New York City. My friends and I took it to a nightclub
                close to Times Square, but the party vibe could be felt everywhere, and that was awesome.

        <h2>Why did I do that trip</h2>
        <div>
           <p>First of, after Australia, I knew that travelling was now part of my life, and that another trip
            had to happen in order to satisfy that need for adventure. So I thought about where I wanted to go,
            and how I could make another long trip happen again.
            </p>
            <p>Australia didn't only spark my love for travels, it also made me realise how much I enjoyed speaking 
                English. From there, I searched on Google "language trip", and I remember clicking on the EF link,
                reading about studying English abroad for a few months, the kind of programs they had to offer, and just 
                like that, I knew what that next adventure was going to be.
            </p>
            <p>Now, why New York. Well, simply because I had always wanted to go there. Having spent my childhood
                watching Marvel movies, watching Spider-Man swing his way through the streets of that city, I had 
                developed a virtual bond with the Big Apple. I wanted to have enough time to visit and explore it,
                and the EF program was perfect for that.
            </p>
            <p>Being part of a program like that one was also a sure way to meet lots of people, which is also why 
                I wanted to travel abroad again. Travelling is such a rich experience when it comes to encounters, 
                bonding with strangers from all over the world, and making friends for life. Although I have great
                friends back home and my family, I will never get enough the very unique, intense and genuine pleasure
                that comes from sharing a drink or having a nice chat that may turn into a lifetime friendship with
                foreigners.
